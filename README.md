# rock-paper-scissors_kotlin

##Learning from **Head First Kotlin**

- I created a Rock Paper Scissors Game where you can play against the system and your choice is evaluated to make a choice using If and else statements.
- I learnt the use of for loops, while loops, variables, functions and formatted strings.
